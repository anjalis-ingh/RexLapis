# RexLapis
Rex Lapis can be used both for fun or as a community engagement tool, to keep or revive quiet servers. He typically acts as the mighty, wise god he once was in his prime but this precious loaf also acts as a laid back friend at times on your server! Everyone is responsible for taking care of the overlord as happiness levels are raised collectively as a server.

As a devoted friend and believer of Rex Lapis, members can interact with him and improve his happiness levels using a variety of petting commands. Members can also interact and ask advice as a friend, pray and gift the god, earn money, shop for items, and more!
